to complete the distance which should be the multiple of 6 between the Sun and Moon.
There are 11 Karanas, viz., (1) Bava, (2) Balava, (3) Kaulava, (4) Taitula, (5) Garija, (6)
Vanija, (7) Visti, (8) Sakuna, (9) Chatushpada, (10) Naga and (11) Kimstughna. The first
seven come by rotation eight times in a lunar month, commencing with the second half of
the first lunar day. The last four are said to be permanent Karanas and occur in order with
the second half of the 29th lunar day
